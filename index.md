## The Problem Space
### We asked ourselves...
How might young adults between the ages of 18-25 in America utilize a gamified approach to mental wellness so that they can improve their mental well-being?

### Our Process
We conducted an online survey targeted towards people between 18-25 in America along with several 1-on-1 interviews. What we found was that many people suffer from some form of mental wellness issue (not illness) and that they often reach for their phones to cope. After analyzing the current market and looking at what potential users have cited as potential needs, our team decided to develop a reflection-based mobile app that would encourage users through a slightly gamified system.

## The Solution

Improving and maintaining our mental wellbeing is a constant uphill battle that is often overlooked. After a difficult year, many are recognizing the importance of mental wellness and the effort needed to maintain it. Research shows that although many are becoming increasingly aware of its importance, few know where to start. For some, reflection can be an important first step.

Leafy uses a gamified approach to mental wellness through reflection and journaling. Although everyone approaches their own wellbeing differently, we hope that Leafy will encourage users to be mindful of their mental wellness through journaling and intentional reflection.

### Benefits
- Users can reflect at their own schedule and convenience; no constant notifications that end up doing more harm than good
- All reflections are saved and searchable, allowing users to see their progress
- Accessories can be purchased/obtained through continuous reflections to encourage users to keep coming back
- Completely free!
